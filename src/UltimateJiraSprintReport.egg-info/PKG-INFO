# Ultimate Jira Sprint Report

## Overview

The **Ultimate Jira Sprint Report** is a Python library designed to generate detailed Agile sprint reports using data from Jira. It provides actionable insights into sprint performance, including burndown charts, velocity metrics, and epic-level statistics.

## Features

- **Sprint Data Loading**: Fetch sprint data directly from Jira.
- **Burndown Charts**: Generate visualizations to track sprint progress.
- **Velocity Metrics**: Analyze sprint predictability and team velocity.
- **Epic and Issue Statistics**: Gain insights into epic-level and issue-level performance.

## Installation

To install the library, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maddogmikeb/UltimateJiraSprintReport.git
   cd UltimateJiraSprintReport
   ```

2. Install the library and its dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies manually:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the library, import it into your Python project and initialize it with your Jira credentials:

```python
from UltimateJiraSprintReport import UltimateJiraSprintReport

# Initialize the report generator
report = UltimateJiraSprintReport(username="your_username", 
                                   password="your_api_key", 
                                   host="your_jira_host")

# Load sprint data
report.load(project="PROJECT_KEY", board_id=123, sprint_id=456)

# Access generated reports
print(report.burndown_chart)  # Path to the burndown chart
print(report.burndown_table)  # Pandas DataFrame with sprint data
```

## Example

To run the application directly, execute the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

Make sure to provide your Jira credentials and the necessary parameters for loading sprint data.
